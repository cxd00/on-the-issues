# on-the-issues

Imagine this :the elections are coming up. You squeeze out some time between cooking dinner and doing the laundry, and decide to search up your local candidates, but what comes up is a mishmash of tabloid-esque headlines and inconclusive news articles. What doesn't come up are the candidate's policies, plain and simple, no political mumbo jumbo or partisan ideology obscuring their platform. Enter: On the Issues! You don't even have to squeeze time out from between dinner and laundry — all you have to do, perhaps while chopping onions, is ask Alexa to launch On the Issues. This skill sorts candidates by issue — for now, women's rights, environmental protections, and the second amendment — allowing you to find candidates who agree with you, rather than digging through endless campaign pages and the annals of twitter for their policies. Currently only up-to-date for the 2018 NC District 4 election.
